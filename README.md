<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The project I built is a small mock ecommerce website. The idea is for someone to visit the website, look at the images available and choose some of them to have them, theoretically, printed and shipped. The images can be favorited and they can also be added to the cart, then over in the Cart page, the user can see a list of the images he chose. The items can also be removed from the cart in case the user decides he doesn't want them anymore. Also the Cart page displays a grand total of what the prints are going to cost. When the user has decided to place the order he can click the Place Order button, which for now is simulating the order by waiting 3 seconds and empties the cart once the order is completed.
From a technical point of view, to build this project I made use of React Routers, React Hooks and Custom Hooks, Context and Proptypes, which all combined allowed me to build it entirely with functional components.
